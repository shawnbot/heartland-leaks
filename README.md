# Heartland Leaks
[The Heartland Institute](http://heartland.org/) is a self-described "think
tank" that funds climate change denialism and sows disinformation through its
PR and lobbying efforts. Recently [leaked documents](http://www.desmogblog.com/heartland-insider-exposes-institute-s-budget-and-strategy)
include their <a href="http://www.desmogblog.com/sites/beta.desmogblog.com/files/(1-15-2012)%202012%20Fundraising%20Plan.pdf">2012 fundraising plan</a>,
which lists the foundation's major donors.

[donors.html](donors.html) lists the corporations, foundations, and individuals
who donated **$10,000** or more in either 2010 or 2011, or are projected to do
so in 2012. The data was scraped from [the leaked PDF](data/2012 Fundraising Plan.pdf),
and can be downloaded [in CSV format](data/2012-donors.csv).
